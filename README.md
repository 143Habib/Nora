# Nora
Nora is my first Python-based AI assistant. It combines text-to-speech, basic command execution, and AI-generated responses. Designed for desktop use, it performs tasks like opening apps, taking screenshots, checking battery status, and answering questions using the Groq API with the LLaMA 3 model.
